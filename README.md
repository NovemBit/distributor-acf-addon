## Description

Distributor ACF add-on is for extending the Distributor plug-in (see [DistributorPlugin.com](https://distributorplugin.com)) 
functionality to distribute 'Advanced Custom Fields', specifically terms, users, galleries.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.6+
* [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) 4.7+
* Distributor plug-in (recommended with [Distributor fork](https://github.com/NovemBit/distributor))

## Install

Download the plug-in from our [github repository](https://github.com/NovemBit/distributor-acf-addon). 

You can upload and install the archived (zip) plugin via the WordPress dashboard (Plugins > Add New -> Upload Plugin) 
or manually inside of the `wp-content/plugins` directory, and activate on the Plugins dashboard.

## Plugin Usage

It's recommended to use the [plug-in fork](https://github.com/NovemBit/distributor) as it's not yet compatible with the 
original plug-in, since the Distributor plug-in modifications to hook up the add-on are not implemented yet on the 
original plug-in.
