## Description

Distributor ACF add-on is for extending the Distributor plug-in (see [DistributorPlugin.com](https://distributorplugin.com)) 
functionality to distribute 'Advanced Custom Fields', specifically terms, users, galleries.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.6+
* [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) 4.7+
* Distributor plug-in (recommended with [Distributor fork](https://github.com/NovemBit/distributor))

## Install

At this moment, Distributor ACF add-on is not yet compatible with original [Distributor](https://github.com/10up/distributor), therefore, please use our  [Distributor fork](https://github.com/NovemBit/distributor) or apply [this patch](https://github.com/10up/distributor/pull/411) on original plugin.

Once you have Distributor instlled, [download the latest master build](https://github.com/NovemBit/distributor-acf-addon/archive/master.zip) and install on your website.

## Plugin Usage

You just need to have Distributor ACF add-on installed on both sides, no additional configuration needed. Please note that this addon was tested for single-site instalation with external connections.
